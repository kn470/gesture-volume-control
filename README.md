# gesture-volume-control
A computer vision program which changes the volume of the computer based on hand gestures

putting the thumb and index finger together will decrease the volume
putting the thumb and middle finger together will increase the volume

idea taken from : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9iEPzbG-xLE&t=1313s
but code not copied
had to look for alternative ways to adjust the volume when the method used in the video kept raising an error
